# Voice-Based-Emotion-Recognition

The objective here is to develop a program that recognises the emotion based on the voice input. The programme uses voice data from which MFCC(Mel-Frequency Ceptral Coefficient) are extracted and passed through a CNN(Convolution Neural Network) model to recognise the emotion. We use Python to build the model and packages such as Librosa, Keras, Pandas, matplotlib were used in this.
